  content: `There’s a huge difference between running a business and running it well. Plenty of leadership books tell you what success looks like, but not how to get there. 303 Software CEO & Founder Matt Jaffe shares his top-choice reads for their practical approaches as much as their insights.

 

  I’ll tell you right from the start: I don’t like most books about business, especially business leadership. Too many of the ones I’ve read are full of mumbo jumbo, focused more on big ideas and less on the steps needed to execute them. I can learn what a servant leader is and does, but not necessarily how to actually be one on a day-to-day basis.
  
  After picking up—and putting down—plenty of recommended reading, I’ve found these five books to be the most influential in shaping my own business philosophy and, in some cases, radically improving the entire operations of 303 Software. We’re even featured in one of them—but not for the reasons you would think.`,
